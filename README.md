# Terminal-based-address-book-project
■ Address Book in C
■ Project Overview
This is a terminal-based Address Book application in C developed as part of my learning journey at
Emertxe Information Technologies. The project simulates how contact details are managed and
stored in real-world systems. It demonstrates efficient usage of arrays, structures, pointers, input
validation, and file-based persistence in C programming.

■ Features
■ Contact Management
• Add, edit, delete, and search contacts.
• Prevent duplicate entries for numbers and emails.
• Mark/unmark contacts as favorites.
■ File-Based Persistence
• Contacts are saved and loaded from structured files.
• Updates are reflected in real-time.
• Data remains persistent across multiple program runs.
■ Validation & Safety
• Mobile number validation (10 digits, numeric).
• Email format verification with duplication checks.
• User-friendly prompts and error handling.
■ Additional Features
• Display all contacts or only favorites in a neat tabular format.
• Sort contacts alphabetically for easy access.

■ Skills Gained
• Modular C Programming
• Arrays, Structures, Pointers
• File I/O Handling
• Input Validation
• Real-world Logic Implementation

■ Challenges Faced
• Handling duplicate entries and input validation.
• Managing dynamic updates in arrays and files.
• Ensuring a smooth and user-friendly CLI experience.
